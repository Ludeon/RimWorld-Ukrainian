  <GoJuice.description>A synthetic performance-enhancing drug developed for space marines during the early days of interplanetary warfare. Go-juice blocks pain, increases movement speed, and improves the user's melee and shooting abilities.\n\nMilitary chemists who created it were never able to remove its addictiveness. Some saw this as a downside; others saw it as a benefit.</GoJuice.description>
